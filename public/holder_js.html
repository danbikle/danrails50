How to use it

Include holder.js in your HTML:

&lt;script src="holder.js">&lt;/script>

Holder will then process all images with a specific src attribute, like this one:

&lt;img src="holder.js/200x300">

The above tag will render as a placeholder 200 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall.

To avoid console 404 errors, you can use data-src instead of src.

Holder also includes support for themes, to help placeholders blend in with your layout. There are 6 default themes: sky, vine, lava, gray, industrial, and social. You can use them like this:

&lt;img src="holder.js/200x300/industrial">

So you have to include holder.js separately than what's included in Bootstrap and that's not explained in the documentation? – bafromca Dec 12 '13 at 6:46

Yes, holder is a separate framework you would be responsible for loading in. github.com/imsky/holder – Dave Collier Jan 9 '14 at 22:05

Bootstrap uses Holder for thumbnails in its documentation.

It's pretty well explained on the Holder github page.

    Include holder.js in your HTML. Holder will then process all images with a specific src attribute... The tag will render as a placeholder. To avoid console 404 errors, you can use data-src instead of src.
